clustr - searching for galaxy clusters in DES

There are numerous algorithms finding galaxy clusters in survey data, ranging
from the very basic counting-in-cells to the advanced and modern Cluster Red
Sequence method.

This code is part of a student project (notmgsk & lconaboy @ UoN) to research and
implement these algorithms, test them on the DES data, and finally produce a
project report.
